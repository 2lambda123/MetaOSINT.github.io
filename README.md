## Mo' OSINT, Mo' Problems?
MetaOSINT ("MO") is here to help.

[Visit the main MetaOSINT site!](https://metaosint.github.io/)

MO enables open-source intelligence ("OSINT") practitioners to quickly identify relevant, publicly-available tools and resources, saving valuable time during investigations, research, and analysis.</p>
    
MO evaluated a staggering 17,000 source links that appeared in a continually growing catalog of "OSINT tool & resource lists" shared throughout the OSINT community. For the first time, MO measured the overlap among these lists, in an effort to highlight the "top" resources, based on number of shared citations. In total, more than 11,000 unique OSINT tools & resources were identified on nearly 30 evaluated lists alone. The MO website specifically provides the 4,810 resources cited multiple times across these lists.
